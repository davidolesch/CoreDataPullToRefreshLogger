CoreDataPullToRefreshLogger
===========================

This app logs the time when you pull to refresh and gives you a random color free of charge. Times logs are saved using CoreData.
 
The CoreData magic happens in https://github.com/davidolesch/CoreDataPullToRefreshLogger/blob/master/CoreDataPullToRefreshLogger/DOLogStore.m
